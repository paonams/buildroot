This is a very simple Solaris device driver (only tested in Solaris 2.6,
although it might work with Solaris 2.5.1) for Intel, which allows user
level programs access to the IO ports of a machine.  This was originally
built for a port of a QuickCam app, but it could be used anywhere.

Rumour has it that the same thing can be done be done with Vx86 stuff, but
I never tried that.  

Have fun with this, and if it's useful, drop me a note at simon@hasc.com

On a Solaris 2.6/ix86 machine, a 'make' and a 'make install' should
install the driver.  You'll also have to reboot with the '-r' flag to
rebuild the /devices directory.

# /usr/sbin/reboot -- -r

This also assumes that one is using gcc, but that should be pretty 
easy to change.

On Solaris 2.8 you will probably need to run add_drv after rebooting, ie:

# add_drv iop

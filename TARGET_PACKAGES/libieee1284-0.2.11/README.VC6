Notes on libieee1284 on Visual C++
----------------------------------

The Makefile.vc6, ieee1284.def and include/config.h.vc6 should allow you to
compile in Visual C++ 6.  These are included for compatibility, and are not
intended to be the definitive source.  Compatibility might be broken some time
in the future, but I hope not.

The VC6 port is the work of Daniel Horchner (apologies for dropping his umlaut).

Enjoy,
